# neogames
Various JavaScript recreations of Neopets games!
(Mainly PHP games... maybe Flash games in a distant future. Far, far away.)

Check it out! There's not much! At the very least, it's kinda working!

# the games
1. Potato Counter (fully working, not thoroughly anti-cheated)
2. Guess the Card (fully working, doesn't need anti-cheat)
3. Test Your Strength (unprogrammed, currently excluded from the repo)

# why?
Because I have fun recreating content. That's it, that's all, no more no less.
