<h1>neogames</h1>

Various JavaScript recreations of Neopets games! (Mainly PHP games... maybe Flash games in a distant future. Far, far away.)

Check it out! There's not much! At the very least, it's kinda working!
<h1>the games</h1>

    Potato Counter (fully working, not thoroughly anti-cheated)
    Guess the Card (fully working, doesn't need anti-cheat)
    Test Your Strength (unprogrammed, currently excluded from the repo)

<h1>why?</h1>

Because I have fun recreating content. That's it, that's all, no more no less.
